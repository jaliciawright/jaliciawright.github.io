            <p> </a>  <br> Work with me! I am available for poetry manuscript consultations. Based on my professional experience, my editing and feedback style is deeply developmental, detail-oriented, rigorous, passionate, and focused on bringing both writer and manuscript to greater clarity and expression. I adhere to market rates, though this is negotiable depending on length and number of consultations, which can take place either in person, over the phone, or Skype. Testimonials and references can be provided upon request. <p></a>   <br> </a>
